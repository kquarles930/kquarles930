- 👋 Hi, I’m Katelin Quarles
- 👀 I’m interested in game development and software engineering, as well as data analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux System Administration and Data Structures and Algorithms in University, and I am learning Graphics and Video Game programming as a personal project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any intermediate level projects that will allow me to apply the programming skills I have while learning how to contribute to real projects in a meaningful way.
  Happy Coding!!
